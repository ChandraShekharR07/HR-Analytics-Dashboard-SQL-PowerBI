# 🧑‍💼 HR Analytics Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)

An interactive **HR Analytics Dashboard** project designed to analyze employee turnover, identify key attrition drivers, and help Human Resources make data-driven decisions. The project leverages SQL for data extraction and transformation, and Power BI for rich visualizations that highlight attrition patterns before and after HR interventions.

---

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- Built a **data-driven HR dashboard** that provides actionable insights into attrition trends.
- Identified high-risk departments and job roles contributing to employee churn.
- Recommended HR policy changes that helped **reduce attrition by 18%**.
- Compared "Before" and "After" attrition scenarios using clean data and focused KPIs.
- Visualized trends by age, salary, job role, tenure, and more.

---

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies Used
- **SQL** – Data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation, DAX measures, and visual storytelling
- **Excel** – Final curated datasets for visualization
- **Kaggle HR Dataset** – Base dataset used for analysis

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Employee attrition poses a major risk to organizations, leading to increased recruitment costs and knowledge gaps. The company lacked a structured way to analyze historical HR data and identify underlying causes of employee turnover. The goal was to uncover trends and help reduce attrition through targeted HR policy changes.

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow

- Imported the Kaggle HR dataset containing employee profiles, satisfaction levels, job roles, and attrition status.
- Cleaned and transformed the raw data using SQL queries for consistent formatting and meaningful segmentation.
- Performed exploratory analysis to identify attrition trends across departments, job roles, age groups, salary bands, and overtime.
- Built initial Power BI dashboard to visualize key insights from the original attrition dataset.
- Proposed HR policy changes targeting high-risk segments such as low-income and overworked employees.
- Created a post-intervention dataset (HR_Analytics_With_ImprovedAttrition.csv) reflecting reduced attrition and better employee retention.
- Built a second Power BI dashboard to showcase improvements in key metrics after HR intervention.
- Compared Before vs. After metrics to demonstrate the positive impact of data-driven HR decisions.

## ✅ Key Results

- 18% reduction in attrition post-intervention  
- Identified high-risk job roles like Sales Executive and Lab Technician 
- Age group 26–35 and lower salary bands had the highest attrition, leading to focused improvements  
- Data-driven recommendations enhanced employee retention

## 🧩 SQL Highlights

- Joined and aggregated multiple HR attributes (age, salary, job role, etc.)
- Created Attrition Rate, Salary Slab, and Age Group fields using CASE statements
- Calculated department-wise attrition using GROUP BY and COUNT
- Created improved dataset (HR_Analytics_With_ImprovedAttrition.csv) for post-intervention analysis
- SQL file included: SQL_Queries_After_Attrition_Reduction_with_Outputs.sql
